            Johanne Aurebekk has a fondness for simplicity. As one of four co-founders of Copenhagen-based design studio Aure, whose output encompasses clothing, art and interiors, her professional emphasis has always been on creating items of enduring appeal. This preference for minimalist chic translates into the way she approaches life, from a wardrobe stocked with reliable basics to taking a considered approach to consumption. In partnership with Uniqlo, the Norwegian-born designer talks to Pip Usher about collaboration, what makes certain clothes so easy to “throw on” in the morning, and why she’d rather make do than rush decisions. 

            Since moving to Denmark, how have you been influenced by the design scene?
            Denmark has always been very good with minimalist design. They create timeless classics and I’ve definitely been inspired by this. I like wearing and designing things that you can look back on over the years and think, “That still works.”
            
            A widely-held aspiration is to live a more stylish life, but with minimal effort. What’s the secret?
            Build up a wardrobe that consists of good basics where most items can be combined. That way you rarely need something new—in the mornings it’s easy because you can throw something on and most things go together.
